    </ul>
    <h2>
        Directions:
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Whisk sugar and cornstarch together in a medium saucepan. Gradually whisk in milk and egg yolks until
            combined. Turn to medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens, 5 to 7 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from heat and whisk in cold butter and vanilla until smooth. Strain through a fine mesh sieve into a
            large bowl. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of custard and refrigerate until cold, 3 to 4
            hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat two 8-inch round cake pans with baking spray and
            line the bottom of each pan with parchment paper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring a medium saucepan filled with 1 inch of water to a simmer over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine eggs, egg yolks, and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Set the mixing bowl over the pot of
            simmering water. Cook, whisking constantly, until a thermometer reaches 110 degrees F (43 degrees C), 5 to 6
            minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Return bowl to the stand mixer. Beat with a whisk attachment on high speed until mixture is pale yellow and
            has tripled in volume, about 3 minutes. Fold in flour until just combined. Fold in melted butter and vanilla
            until combined. Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans.
        </li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean, 20 to 22
        minutes. Let cool in pan 10 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack and let cool completely, about 1 hour. Use a long,
        serrated knife to split each cake layer in half horizontally. Set cake aside until pastry cream is ready to use.
        </li>
        <li>
            Assemble cake: spread the cut side of each cake layer with warm raspberry jam. Place one cake layer,
            jam-side up, on a cake plate. Spread 1/2 cup pastry cream over cake. Repeat process with two more cake
            layers, ending with remaining cake layer on top, jam-side down. Place a 4-inch wooden skewer through the
            middle of the cake to hold layers in place. Reserve remaining remaining pastry cream for another use.
        </li>
        <li>
            Beat heavy cream and 1/4 cup powdered sugar at medium-high speed with an electric mixer in a large bowl
            until stiff peaks form. Spread a thin layer of whipped cream around side of cake. Mound remaining whipped
            cream on top of cake, spreading to create a smooth dome.
        </li>
        <li>
            Knead together marzipan and gel food dye until color is evenly distributed. Roll out marzipan in between 2
            sheets of parchment paper, to a 15-inch circle; gently remove top piece of parchment paper. Invert marzipan
            and drape over cake; gently remove remaining parchment paper. Gently press marzipan down over cake, starting
            at the top of cake and working your way down to create a smooth dome. Cut away any excess and tuck ends of
            marzipan under cake.
        </li>
        <li>
            Before serving, dust top of cake with sifted powdered sugar and garnish with fresh raspberries.
